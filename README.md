<h1>Count Regression</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is based off of the textbook "Extending the Linear Model with R" by Julian J. Faraway. These are exercises completed based off of Chapter 5: Count Regression, where I compute poisson, gaussian, and quasipoisson models. Dispersian parameters and F-tests are computed. Residuals and other trends are observed.
